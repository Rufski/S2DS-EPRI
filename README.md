## Data 

For the time being the data used in this project are synthetic data (generated by appropriate models) provided in `csv` format by EPRI. 

### How to Get and Extract the Data

Download the folder as a zip archive from this project's [box.com storage](https://app.box.com/folder/117614749421) provided by EPRI. Use the bash script provided at FIXME to extract the data. 

### Types of Synthetic Data

(taken from Daniel's comments on the data)

- Basic - only deterministic losses (basic PV behavior) and degradation (labeled)
- Soil - soiling loss (labeled) in addition to degradation
- Weather - performance under real weather conditions (weather years shuffled randomly per dataset), degradation loss included but no soiling loss
- Soil Weather  - soiling loss added to Weather
- Soil Weather Locations - weather conditions are taken from 7 different locations (1 per dataset, included in filename) - weather years shuffled

### Dataset Specifications

There are no missing data points in these synthetic datasets. The datasets are given in the form of time series over 5 years in 1 minute intervals (2629440 data points). The timestamps of the data points are given in local time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ssTimezone`, e.g., `2019-12-31 23:59:00-05:00 for UTC-05:00`.

For each data point of the time series the following attributes are provided:

| Attribute               | Column name             |  Units |
|-------------------------|:-----------------------:|-------:|
| Power                   | Power                   | kW     |
| Plane of array          | POA                     | W/m^2  |
| Ambient Temperatur      | Tamb                    | Â°C     |
| Wind                    | Wind                    | ??     |
| Degradation rate / year | Degradation_rate_per_yr | -      |
| Soiling                 | soiling                 | -      |

## Conventions and Style 

### Git

Our team's git workflow is inspired by the guide provided [here]( https://www.robinwieruch.de/git-team-workflow) (we don't strictly follow these rules). Branches are named using the template `issueID-short-description` (e.g., `001-update-readme`), where `issueID` is the ID of the corresponding issue on our github project page, see [this guide](https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/) for more information.  

### Codebase

The project structure of this github repository adheres to the Cookiecutter Data Science template provided [here](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

### Coding Style

This project uses the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for coding in python. The docstrings we use Google style, see, e.g., [here](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
